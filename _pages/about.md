I am an undergraduate student in Automation at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)), advised by Prof. [Zhiyun Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ic9y2dIAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a member of [Autonomous and Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS) Lab](https://github.com/SUSTech-AMASLAB) at SUSTech and a part-time intern researcher in the Advanced Robotics Research Institute at Anker Innovations.

My research interests lie at the intersection of robot learning and robot vision. Specifically, I am excited about developing novel methods that enable robots to efficiently acquire diverse, high-precision manipulation skills while generalizing to unseen objects and scenarios.

Previously, I worked on zero-shot 7-DoF grasps detection with Prof. [Zhiyun Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ic9y2dIAAAAJ&hl=en) at SUSTech. Recently, I focused on imitation learning and was conducting research with Prof. [Miao Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=hPQY4voAAAAJ) at Anker Innovations.
