I am now an undergraduate in the School of System Design and Intelligent Manufacturing ([SDIM](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/colleges/school-of-system-design-and-intelligent-manufacturing.html))  at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)), advised by Prof. [Zhiyun Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ic9y2dIAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a member of [Autonomous and Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS) Lab](https://github.com/SUSTech-AMASLAB) at SUSTech. This summer, I will work as an intern at National University of Singpore (NUS), supervised by Prof. [Lin Shao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UU76Pg4AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie at the intersection of robot learning and computer vision. I am excited about developing novel methods that enable robots to efficiently acquire diverse, high-precision manipulation skills while generalizing to unseen objects and scenarios.

Previously, I worked on zero-shot 7-DoF grasp pose detection and cross-embodiment manipulation skills transfer. Recently, I am doing research on dexterous grasping and reinforcement learning.
