I am currently an undergraduate student in the School of Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)), where I am advised by Prof. [Zhiyun Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ic9y2dIAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a member of the Autonomous and Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS) Lab. In Fall 2025, I will join the [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania as a master's student.

I am passionate about robot learning and computer vision. My research focuses on developing efficient machine learning algorithms to facilitate skill acquisition and out-of-domain generalization on various robotic platforms.
