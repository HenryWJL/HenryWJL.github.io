I am an undergraduate student in Automation at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)), advised by Prof. [Zhiyun Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ic9y2dIAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a part-time intern researcher at Anker Innovations in the Advanced Robotics Research Institute.

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie in the intersection of robotics, machine learning and computer vision. I am excited about developing new methods that allow robots to efficiently acquire diverse manipulation skills by learning from vision data.
