I am an undergraduate in the School of System Design and Intelligent Manufacturing ([SDIM](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/colleges/school-of-system-design-and-intelligent-manufacturing.html)) at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)), advised by Prof. [Max Q.-H. Meng](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=DxDCU7AAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Zhiyun Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ic9y2dIAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a member of the Autonomous and Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS) Lab. This summer, I am working as an intern in the School of Computing at National University of Singpore (NUS), supervised by Prof. [Lin Shao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UU76Pg4AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie at the intersection of robot learning and computer vision. I am excited about developing novel methods that allow robots to efficiently acquire diverse, high-quality manipulation skills while generalizing to unseen tasks and scenarios.

Previously, I focused on zero-shot 7-DoF grasp pose detection and imitation learning (behavior cloning). Recently, I am conducting research on RL-based dexterous grasping.
