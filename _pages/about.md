I am an undergraduate student in the School of System Design and Intelligent Manufacturing ([SDIM](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/colleges/school-of-system-design-and-intelligent-manufacturing.html)) at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)), where I am advised by Professors [Max Q.-H. Meng](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=DxDCU7AAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Zhiyun Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ic9y2dIAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a member of the Autonomous and Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS) Lab. This summer, I will be interning at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS), under the supervision of Professor [Lin Shao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UU76Pg4AAAAJ&hl=en).

I am passionate about robot learning and computer vision. My research focuses on developing innovative methods that enable robots to efficiently acquire manipulation skills and generalize to unseen scenarios with minimal adaptation.

Currently, I am conducting research on reinforcement learning-based dexterous grasping at LinS Lab. I am also closely following the latest advancements in imitation learning, particularly in task-conditioned policy learning and cross-embodiment learning.
