I am an undergraduate student in the School of Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)), where I am co-advised by Prof. [Max Q.-H. Meng](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=DxDCU7AAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Zhiyun Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ic9y2dIAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a member of the Autonomous and Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS) Lab.

I am passionate about robot learning and computer vision. My research focuses on developing efficient machine learning algorithms to accelerate robotic skill acquisition and enable robust out-of-domain generalization.

This semester, I am working with Prof. [Chaoyang Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qhJ2cf0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at the [Bionic Design and Learning (BionicDL) Lab](https://bionicdl.ancorasir.com/). I am also seeking Ph.D. opportunities starting in Fall 2025.
