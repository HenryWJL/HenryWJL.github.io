I am a master's student in the [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), advised by Dr. [Dinesh Jayaraman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/). I earned my bachelor’s degree from the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), where I was co-advised by Dr. [Zhiyun Lin](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/zhiyunlin-2.html), Dr. [Max Q.-H. Meng](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/mengqinghu.html), and Dr. [Chaoyang Song](https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/en/jiaozhiyuangong/2978.html).

I am passionate about robot learning and computer vision. My research focuses on developing efficient machine learning algorithms to facilitate skill acquisition and out-of-domain generalization on various robotic platforms.
