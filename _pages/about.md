I am an undergraduate student in Automation at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)), advised by Prof. [Zhiyun Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ic9y2dIAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a part-time intern researcher at Anker Innovations in the Advanced Robotics Research Institute.

My research interests lie at the intersection of robot learning and robot vision. Specifically, I am excited about developing novel methods that enable robots to efficiently acquire diverse, high-precision manipulation skills while generalizing to unseen objects and scenarios.
