I am an undergraduate student in the School of System Design and Intelligent Manufacturing ([SDIM](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/colleges/school-of-system-design-and-intelligent-manufacturing.html)) at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)), where I am advised by Professors [Max Q.-H. Meng](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=DxDCU7AAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Zhiyun Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ic9y2dIAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a member of the Autonomous and Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS) Lab.

I am passionate about robot learning and computer vision. My research focuses on developing innovative methods that enable robots to efficiently acquire manipulation skills and generalize to unseen scenarios with minimal adaptation.

In fall 2024, I will work with Dr. [Chaoyang Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qhJ2cf0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at [BionicDL Lab](https://bionicdl.ancorasir.com/) and contribute to his research project on data collection.
