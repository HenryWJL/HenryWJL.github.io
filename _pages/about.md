I am an undergraduate in the School of System Design and Intelligent Manufacturing ([SDIM](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/colleges/school-of-system-design-and-intelligent-manufacturing.html)) at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)), advised by Professor [Max Q.-H. Meng](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=DxDCU7AAAAAJ&hl=en) and Professor [Zhiyun Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ic9y2dIAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a member of the Autonomous and Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS) Lab. This summer, I will be interning in the School of Computing at National University of Singapore (NUS), under the supervision of Professor [Lin Shao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UU76Pg4AAAAJ&hl=en).

I am passionate about robot learning and computer vision. My research focus is on developing innovative methods that enable robots to efficiently acquire manipulation skills and generalize to unseen scenarios with minimal adaptation.

I am currently conducting research on RL-based dexterous grasping at LinS Lab. I am also closely following the latest developments in imitation learning, particularly in goal-conditioned policy learning and cross-embodiment transfer learning.
