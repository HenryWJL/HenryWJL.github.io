I am an undergraduate majoring in Automation at Southern University of Science and Technology ([SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)), advised by Prof. [Zhiyun Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ic9y2dIAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also a member of [Autonomous and Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS) Lab](https://github.com/SUSTech-AMASLAB) at SUSTech and a part-time intern in the Advanced Robotics Research Institute at [Anker Innovations](https://en.anker-in.com/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of robot learning and computer vision. I am excited about developing novel methods that enable robots to efficiently acquire diverse, high-precision manipulation skills while generalizing to unseen objects and scenarios.

Previously, I worked on few-shot 7-DoF grasp pose detection with Prof. Zhiyun Lin. Recently, I have been researching imitation learning, knowledge distillation, and diffusion models.s
